    "# <font style=\"color:blue\">Project 1: Implement a CNN based Image Classifier using Azure Cloud</font>\n",
    "In previous assignments, you have trained CNNs on datasets of small images like MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10 available inside torchvision. While those are good enough to get started, they surely lack the complexity which you will encounter in real-world problems. You were also given most of the code and were asked to write only small parts of code to complete the assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will write most of the code yourself (you should be able to do so by taking reference from whatever has been taught in the course as well as the code we have shared). \n",
    "\n",
    "### <font style=\"color:green\">Task </font>\n",
    "You will **implement a 3-class Image Classifier using a CNN** on a dataset consisting of 1000 images each of **Panda, Cat and Dog**. The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishsaxena2209/animal-image-datasetdog-cat-and-panda). We have split it into 80:20 ratio for train:validation which you can download from [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n5nya3g3airlub6/AACi7vaUjdTA0t2j_iKWgp4Ra?dl=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font style = \"color:rgb(200,0,0)\">You should build your own network and not use any pre-trained network/weights for this task. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font style=\"color:green\">The purpose of this Project is two-fold:</font>\n",
    "1. The first is to get your hands dirty with training a neural network from scratch so that you understand what it takes to build and train a real network on real data. You will implement everything - right from getting the data to analysing the final results. \n",
    "1. The second is to reinforce the use of the complete training pipeline we suggested in our previous lecture. In practice, You should try to stick to this pipeline whenever you work on a new problem.\n"
